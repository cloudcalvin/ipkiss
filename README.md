# RIPKISS [WIP]
IPKISS is a parametric design framework focused (but not limited) to Photonic circuit design, originally constructed at Ghent University and IMEC.

RIPKISS intends to extend the IPKISS 2.4 framework to allow DRC checking of the generated layouts by generating a rust verification engine based on the layout and rules..

## Installation
TODO..
